Scan the layout of the repository as it currently exists.

Your task is to identify and suggest for pruning any unnecessary documentation that has been generated.

If the repository is public-facing, or even if it's not, a README may be highly desirable. There may be some additional documentation describing specific components or features.

However, documentation describing individual edits or time-limited information that you can determine with confidence was generated by an AI agent should be removed unless there is a compelling reason to keep it in the repository.

As an alternative to deletion, elements of it can be integrated into the main README. The overarching objective is to ensure that there is not an overwhelming influx of unnecessary documentation files scattered throughout the repository, but especially at the root level.
