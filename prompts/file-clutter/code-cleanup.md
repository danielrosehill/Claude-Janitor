Identify any old legacy code in this project. To do this, look at the current state of the application as you can determine it from the main entry point or main application script. 

After assessing its functionalities, you can see if you can identify any folders or paths in the repository that seem to point to old or deprecated code. 

If you are in any doubt as to whether a file or repository path might not be legacy, ask the user for clarification. But if you can determine with reasonable certainty that it is code that has been abandoned or is old, then you should delete it.
