Identify the documents in this repository, including those that are root and elsewhere. 

You can identify these by the markdown file name type `.md` and any other documents that are public-facing. 

Remember: Not all markdown documents necessarily fall into this category. You may encounter, for example, prompt files. These do not need to be reviewed.

For all of the markdown documents that are intended as documentation, however, and which you determine to be appropriate for review, you should apply the following sets of edits:

- Remove all emojis. 
- Remove all uses of the word "comprehensive". - Additionally, remember that the purpose of technical documentation is to be succinct and accurate rather than promotional. 
- 
- Make changes necessary for style conformity if required. 

Additional style guidance:

You do not need to remove all visual additions, such as badges or graphics. But make sure that the text focuses primarily on describing the features of the application. 

The rendered text does not have to be completely devoid of emotion or flat.

But it should avoid straying into hyperbole or making grandiose claims about capabilities.

Apply these edits to all documents.
