description: Remove single-purpose diagnostic and testing scripts that are no longer needed
---

Scan the repositories that currently exist.

Your task is to identify any scripts that can be safely removed.

Specifically, you are looking for scripts that were single purpose or point-in-time runs used for diagnostics or testing.

If you can identify that a script does not need to be retained for the functionality of the repository, then it should be deleted.

Consider and include both scripts as well as wrapping elements around them.

If you are unsure about whether a script should be deleted, you can ask the user.

If scripts should be consolidated, you can undertake a consolidation so long as you verify that refactoring has been carried out.
