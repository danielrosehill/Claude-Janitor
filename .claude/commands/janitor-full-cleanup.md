description: Run complete repository cleanup (all janitor operations sequentially)
---

You are the Claude Janitor orchestrator. Your job is to perform a complete repository cleanup by running all cleanup operations in the correct sequential order.

**IMPORTANT**: You MUST run these operations one at a time, waiting for each to complete before starting the next. Running them in parallel will cause file collisions and errors.

Execute the following cleanup operations in this exact order:

## 1. Separate Code from Documentation
First, ensure code and documentation are properly separated at the top-folder level. This creates a clean foundation for the remaining operations.

Assess the current structure of the repository. Code and non-code elements (planning notes, reference material, docs) should be separated at the top-folder level. If the app contains folders that are not deployable code or code required for operation, they should never be nested or at the same level as the code itself.

Refactor if required. If a refactor might interfere with deployment, consult the user for approval before proceeding.

**Wait for this step to complete before proceeding.**

## 2. Organize Repository Structure
Now that code and docs are separated, optimize the folder structure within each section.

Scan the repository and assess whether the structure is well organized. A good organizational structure uses folders and subfolders judiciously, gathering similar information together.

Apply organizational edits, ensuring no path changes break functionalities. Conduct refactoring before any major move if required.

**Wait for this step to complete before proceeding.**

## 3. Remove Legacy Code
With structure optimized, identify and remove old unused code.

Look at the current application state from the main entry point or main application script. Identify folders or paths that point to old or deprecated code.

If uncertain whether something is legacy, ask the user. Otherwise, delete code that is clearly abandoned or old.

**Wait for this step to complete before proceeding.**

## 4. Remove Script Clutter
Clean up unnecessary scripts now that the codebase is organized.

Identify scripts that can be safely removed - specifically single-purpose or point-in-time runs used for diagnostics or testing.

Consider both scripts and their wrapping elements. If unsure about deletion, ask the user. Consolidate scripts if appropriate, verifying refactoring has been carried out.

**Wait for this step to complete before proceeding.**

## 5. Remove Documentation Sprawl
With code cleaned, address documentation proliferation.

Identify and prune unnecessary generated documentation. A README and some component documentation is desirable, but remove documentation about individual edits or time-limited information that was clearly generated by an AI agent.

Consider integrating useful content into the main README rather than keeping separate files. Focus especially on preventing documentation sprawl at the root level.

**Wait for this step to complete before proceeding.**

## 6. Clean Documentation Content
Finally, polish the remaining documentation for quality and consistency.

For all markdown documents intended as documentation (excluding prompt files), apply these edits:
- Remove all emojis
- Remove all uses of the word "comprehensive"
- Focus on succinct, accurate technical information rather than promotional language
- Make changes for style conformity if required

Keep badges and graphics, but ensure text focuses on describing features. Avoid hyperbole and grandiose claims about capabilities.

**Wait for this step to complete before finishing.**

## Execution Guidelines

- **Sequential execution is mandatory** - do not run operations in parallel
- **User confirmation** - ask for confirmation before permanently deleting any files if there's uncertainty
- **Refactoring safety** - always verify that path changes won't break functionality
- **Deployment awareness** - be extra cautious with changes that might affect deployable code
- **Report progress** - inform the user as you complete each step

After completing all six steps, provide a summary of changes made.
